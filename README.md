**E-Commerce: Product Range Analysis**

An on-line store that sells household goods, is interested in knowing what are the products and product categories, that create the greatest profit and customer satisfaction. The results of this analysis are meant to help the on-line store decide what products should they advertise more, should they lower the prices for some of them, what products categories should they create, are there specific times to sell specific categorical products and are there products that they need to stop selling all together.
